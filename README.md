# Control of a Robotic Arm

In this project, I have worked closely with an undergraduate student from Caltech University to control a robotic arm. This project involved a planning stage where we created a schedule that we could work towards. Following this, we set up a virtual environment using Google Colaboratory to simulate systems using MuJoCo and selected a robotic arm model from the internet - the Franka Emika Panda Arm.

## Key Takeaways

- Understood cloud-based computing using Google Colaboratory.
- Learned about simulating physical systems using MuJoCo.
- Implemented XML design for configuring scenes and using PID controllers for precise robotic movements.
- Experimented with controlling robotic arm actuators
- Learned to program the arm to autonomously pick up a
block at random positions through actuator control.
- Although the gradient descent algorithm I programmed using inverse kinematics was unsuccessful, it enhanced my understanding of robotic arm control.
